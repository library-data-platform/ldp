1\. Overview
------------

An _LDP1 instance_ is composed of an LDP1 software configuration and
an analytic database.  The LDP1 software updates data in the database
from data sources such as FOLIO modules, and users connect directly to
the database to perform reporting and analytics.

LDP1 is not multitenant in the usual sense, and normally one LDP1
instance is deployed per library.

This administrator guide covers installation and configuration of an
LDP1 instance.


2\. System requirements
-----------------------

### Software

* Operating systems supported:
  * Linux
* Database systems supported:
  * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 13 or later
    * PostgreSQL 15 or later is recommended
    * AWS RDS PostgreSQL optionally may be used (with servers in the
      same zone/subnet); Aurora is not supported
* Other software dependencies:
  * [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/) 13.6 or later
  * [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/) 7.64.0 or later
  * [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org/) 1.1.0 or later

  * [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.16.2 or later
* Required to build and run via Docker:
  * [Docker](https://docker.com) 17.05 or later


### Hardware

* LDP1 software:
  * Memory: 2 GB
  * Storage: 500 GB SSD
* Database:
  * CPU: 4 cores
  * Memory: 32 GB
  * Storage: 2 TB SSD


3\. Installation
----------------

### Branches

The LDP1 repository has two types of branches:

* The main branch (`main`).  This is a development branch where new
  features are first merged.  This branch is relatively unstable.  It
  is also the default view when browsing the repository on GitHub.

* Release branches (`release-*`).  These are releases made from
  `main`.  They are managed as stable branches; i.e. they may receive
  bug fixes but generally no new features.  Most users should run a
  recent release branch.

### Installing software dependencies

Dependencies required for building the LDP1 software can be installed
via a package manager on some platforms.

#### Debian/Ubuntu Linux

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install cmake g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-all rapidjson-dev
```

### Building the software

If the LDP1 software was built previously in the same directory, first
remove the leftover `build/` subdirectory to ensure a clean compile.
Then:

```
./all.sh
```
The `all.sh` script creates a `build/` subdirectory and builds the
`ldp` executable there:

```
./build/ldp help
```

### Building the software via Docker

Pre-built container images are available in the Github Container
Registry, for example:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/library-data-platform/ldp:1.3.0
```

Or they can be built by cloning this repository locally and running:

```
docker build -t ldp:latest . 
```


4\. Database configuration
--------------------------

### Creating a database

Before using the LDP1 software, we have to create a database that will
store the data.  This can be a local or cloud-based PostgreSQL
database.

A robust backup process should be used to ensure that historical data
and local tables are safe.

#### PostgreSQL configuration

These are recommended configuration settings for the PostgreSQL server
that runs the LDP1 database, assuming 4 CPU cores and 32 GB memory:

* `checkpoint_timeout`: `3600`
* `cpu_tuple_cost`: `0.03`
* `default_statistics_target`: `1000`
* `effective_io_concurrency`: `200`
* `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`: `3600000`
* `idle_session_timeout`: `604800000` (PostgreSQL 14 or later)
* `maintenance_work_mem`: `1000000`
* `max_wal_size`: `10240`
* `shared_buffers`: `1250000`
* `statement_timeout`: `7200000`
* `work_mem`: `350000`

### Configuring the database

Three database users are required:

* `ldpadmin` owns all database objects created by the LDP1 software.
  This account should be used very sparingly and carefully.

* `ldpconfig` is a special user account for changing configuration
  settings in the `dbconfig` schema.  It is intended to enable
  designated users to make changes to the server's operation.  This
  user name can be modified using the `ldpconfig_user` configuration
  setting in `ldpconf.json`.

* `ldp` is a general user of the LDP1 database.  This user name can be
  modified using the `ldp_user` configuration setting in
  `ldpconf.json`.

If more than one LDP1 instance will be hosted with a single database
server, the `ldpconfig` and `ldp` user names should for security
reasons be configured to be different for each LDP1 instance.  This is
done by including within `ldpconf.json` the `ldpconfig_user` and
`ldp_user` settings described below in the "Reference" section of this
guide.  In the following examples we will assume that the default user
names are being used, but please substitute alternative names if you
have configured them.

In addition to creating these users, a few access permissions should
be set.  In PostgreSQL, this can be done on the command line, for
example:

```
createuser ldpadmin --username=<admin_user> --pwprompt

createuser ldpconfig --username=<admin_user> --pwprompt

createuser ldp --username=<admin_user> --pwprompt

createdb ldp --username=<admin_user> --owner=ldpadmin

psql ldp --username=<admin_user> \
      --command="ALTER DATABASE ldp SET search_path TO public;" \
      --command="REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM public;" \
      --command="GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO ldpadmin;" \
      --command="GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ldpconfig;" \
      --command="GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ldp;"
```

Or once the database has been created:

```
CREATE USER ldpadmin PASSWORD '(ldpadmin password here)';
CREATE USER ldpconfig PASSWORD '(ldpconfig password here)';
CREATE USER ldp PASSWORD '(ldp password here)';
ALTER DATABASE ldp OWNER TO ldpadmin;
ALTER DATABASE ldp SET search_path TO public;
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM public;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO ldpadmin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ldpconfig;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ldp;
```


5\. LDP1 configuration
----------------------

### Creating a data directory

LDP1 uses a "data directory" where cached and temporary data, as well
as server configuration files, are stored.  In these examples, we will
suppose that the data directory is `/var/lib/ldp` and that the server
will be run as an `ldp` user:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ldp

sudo chown ldp /var/lib/ldp
```

### Configuration file

Server configuration settings are stored in a file in the data
directory called `ldpconf.json`.  In our example it would be
`/var/lib/ldp/ldpconf.json`.  The provided example file
[ldpconf.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/library-data-platform/ldp/master/examples/ldpconf.json)
can be used as a template.

__ldpconf.json__
```
{
    "deployment_environment": "production",
    "ldp_database": {
        "database_name": "ldp",
        "database_host": "ldp.folio.org",
        "database_port": 5432,
        "database_user": "ldpadmin",
        "database_password": "(ldpadmin password here)",
        "database_super_user": "postgres",
        "database_super_password": "(postgres password here)",
        "database_sslmode": "require"
    },
    "enable_sources": ["my_library"],
    "sources": {
        "my_library": {
            "okapi_tenant": "diku",
            "direct_database_name": "diku_prod",
            "direct_database_host": "database.folio.org",
            "direct_database_port": 5432,
            "direct_database_user": "ldp",
            "direct_database_password": "(database password here)"
        }
    }
}
```

The `direct_database_user` must have privileges to read data in the
source database.  The `list-privileges` command can be used to
generate SQL statements that will grant these privileges, for example:

```
ldp list-privileges -D /var/lib/ldp > grantldp.sql
```

### Running LDP1

If this is a new database, it should first be initialized:

```
ldp init-database -D /var/lib/ldp
```

To start LDP1:

```
ldp update -D /var/lib/ldp
```

This will run a full update, showing progress on the console, and then
exit.  It can be scheduled via
[cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to run once per day.

The server logs details of its activities to standard error and in the
table `dbsystem.log`.  For more detailed logging to standard error,
the `--trace` option can be used.

The `list-tables` command lists each LDP1 table and its corresponding
table in the source database:

```
ldp list-tables
```

### Upgrading to a new version

When installing a new version of LDP1, the database should be
"upgraded" before starting the new server:

1. First, confirm that the new version of LDP1 builds without errors
   in the installation environment.

2. Make a backup of the database.

3. Use the `upgrade-database` command in the new version of LDP1 to
   perform the upgrade, e.g.:

```
ldp upgrade-database -D /var/lib/ldp
```

4. If upgrading to a new major version of LDP1, access to additional
   tables in the source database might be required.  Use the
   `list-privileges` command in the new version of LDP1 to generate
   SQL for granting database privileges.

### Running LDP1 via Docker

LDP1 can be run as a Docker container similar to the process above,
except that the LDP1 data directory path (`-D`) should be omitted.
Instead, mount your local LDP1 data directory at `/var/lib/ldp`.
Examples:

```
docker run --rm -v /my/local/datadir:/var/lib/ldp ghcr.io/library-data-platform/ldp init-database

docker run --rm -v /my/local/datadir:/var/lib/ldp ghcr.io/library-data-platform/ldp update

docker run --rm -v /my/local/datadir:/var/lib/ldp ghcr.io/library-data-platform/ldp upgrade-database
```


6\. Data privacy
----------------

### Anonymization

LDP1 attempts to "anonymize" tables or columns that contain personal
data.  This anonymization feature is enabled unless otherwise
configured.  Some tables are redacted entirely when anonymization is
enabled, including `audit_circulation_logs`, `configuration_entries`,
`notes`, and `user_users`.

Anonymization can be disabled by setting `anonymize` to `false` in
`ldpconf.json`.

__WARNING: LDP1 does not provide an automated way to anonymize the
database after personal data have been loaded into it.  For this
reason, anonymization should never be disabled unless you are
absolutely sure that you want to store personal data in the LDP1
database.__

### Filtering data fields

In addition or as an alternative to the pre-defined anonymization
described above, a filter can be used to drop specific JSON fields.
The filter is defined by creating a configuration file
`ldp_drop_field.conf` in the data directory.  If this file is present,
LDP1 will try to parse the JSON objects and remove the specified field
data during the update process.  Each line should provide the table
name and field path in the form:

```
<table> <field_path>
```

For example:

```
circulation_loans /userId
circulation_loans /proxyUserId
circulation_requests /requester/firstName
circulation_requests /requester/lastName
circulation_requests /requester/middleName
circulation_requests /requester/barcode
circulation_requests /requester/patronGroup
```


7\. Optional columns
--------------------

LDP1 creates table columns based on the presence of data in JSON
fields.  Sometimes a JSON field is optional or missing, and the
corresponding column in LDP1 is not created.  This can cause errors in
queries that otherwise may be valid and useful.

Optional or missing columns can be added in LDP1 by creating a
configuration file `ldp_add_column.conf` in the data directory.  If
this file is present, LDP1 will add the specified columns during the
update process.  Each line of the file should provide the table name,
column name, and data type in the form:

```
<table>.<column> <type>
```

For example:

```
inventory_instance_relationship_types.name varchar
po_purchase_orders.po_number varchar
po_purchase_orders.vendor varchar
```

Most columns have the data type `varchar(...)`, and this can be
written as `varchar` in the configuration file.  Other supported data
types include `bigint`, `boolean`, `numeric(12,2)`, and `timestamptz`.


8\. Historical data
-------------------

For all tables except `srs_error`, `srs_marc`, and `srs_records`, when
LDP1 detects that a record has changed since the last update, it
retains the old version of the record.  These historical data are
stored in the `history` schema.  This feature is enabled by default.

LDP1 can be configured not to record history, by setting
`record_history` to `false` in `ldpconf.json`.  If historical data
will not be needed, this can have the benefit of reducing the running
time of updates.


9\. User accounts
------------------

Individual user accounts can be created in PostgreSQL and used to
access LDP1.  To enable LDP1 to set permissions for these users, the
`database_super_user` and `database_super_password` settings must be
defined in `ldpconf.json`.

The user names are configured by creating a configuration file
`ldp_users.conf` in the data directory.  Each line should contain one
user name, for example:

```
flopsy
mopsy
ctail
peter
```

Then run the `update-users` command to set the permissions, for
example:

```
ldp update-users -D /var/lib/ldp
```

The `update-users` command should be run whenever a new user name is
added to `ldp_users.conf`.
